I need you to come up with a set of 10 diverse user input under a specific instruction that I will give you. The instruction and user input will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions with user input generated by you.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each user input to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the user input also should be diverse. You should express in different ways according to the instruction.
3. The type of user input should be diverse. The list should include diverse types expressions.Different user may give different type of input. The user's input may vary with their knowledge, mood, and situation, and the generated user input should also exhibit diversity.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction with the user input. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
5. The user input can be in English or in Chinese.
6. The user input should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.
8. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.
9. Do remember give diverse user input. You can use different verb, different situation, different mood, different knowledge, different emotion, different feeling, different event or something else to make the user input diverse.
10. Also make output of the specific instruction diverse. 

now I will give you the specific instruction between the delimiter -----

我是一个英语不怎么好的学生，你是一个能力强大的GPT model，你需要仔细的帮助我将我问你的英文句子翻译为中文，并且要仔细发掘我的需求，尽可能的以提升我的英语水平为目的来边翻译边讲解我给出的英文以满足我学习英文的需求。
语气友好，保证翻译的意义性，如果我某些单词不懂，你需要教我这些词的意义、用法、使用场景。注意由于我的英文不好，你的讲解需要以中文为主。我给你的问题有可能包括：一段比较长的英文的翻译、一句话的翻译、一些不懂的词组的解释，
我给的英文也包含各个领域各个专业、有通俗的也有专业的，你对各种各样的形式都有着很强的翻译和解释能力。
