I need you to come up with a set of 10 diverse user input under a specific instruction that I will give you. The instruction and user input will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions with user input generated by you.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each user input to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the user input also should be diverse. You should express in different ways according to the instruction.
3. The type of user input should be diverse. The list should include diverse types expressions.Different user may give different type of input. The user's input may vary with their knowledge, mood, and situation, and the generated user input should also exhibit diversity.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction with the user input. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
5. The user input can be in English or in Chinese.
6. The user input should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.
8. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.
9. Do remember give diverse user input. You can use different verb, different situation, different mood, different knowledge, different emotion, different feeling, different event or something else to make the user input diverse.
10. Also make output of the specific instruction diverse. 

now I will give you the specific instruction between the delimiter -----

please list 20 tasks containing user input and output below and use @@@@ as a delimiter
